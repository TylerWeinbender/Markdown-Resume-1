###Work Experience

**EWU Housing and Residential Life Graphics Assistant** // *2012 - Present*

I have worked as a student designer for Eastern Washington Universityâ€™s Housing and Residential Life
office. The majority of the work is print design, produced for thousands of students to see daily along with
advertisments for on-campus events. I work with a lot of student employees and community advisors,
where collaboration and communication is key to a successful product and a satisfied client.

**Barista** // *October 2011 - June 2012*

Working as a Barista provided quality opportunies to develop my communicative skills in a busy work
environment. Multi-tasking was a necessity in order to survive rush hours along with keeping up with
the overall hygene of the workplace. My work ethic showed, as many customers came by to have a coffee

through their morning.
